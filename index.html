        <p>Hello World! My name is Triston Tetley. I am a very self-motivated and driven to set out and do anything that
            I set my mind to. Everything that I get myself into whether intentional or just by being in the right/wrong
            place at the right/wrong time I give it my all. I don't settle for mediocre my best is all I have to give.
            Some of my favorite things to do when free time is available is go to the movies with my family, go to the
            gym and try to crack poorly thought up dad jokes with elders at the gym. Since they seem to laugh at those
            things, and lastly my favorite thing to do is compete in competitive gaming tournaments.</p>
